# TLS settings are in line with current leading practice
-------

## Description:

TLS settings must always be in line with current leading practice. Whenever TLS
settings and cyphers get outdated, the TLS connection can be degraded/broken and used by
attackers to eavesdrop on users traffic over the application.

## Solution:

There should be structural scans that are done regurarly against the applications TLS settings
and configurations to check whether the TLS settings are in line with current leading practice.

This could be achieved by using the SSLLabs api or the OWASP O-Saft project.

O-Saft is an easy to use tool to show informations about SSL certificate and tests the SSL 
connection according given list of ciphers and various SSL configurations.

It's designed to be used by penetration testers, security auditors or server administrators. 
The idea is to show the important informations or the special checks with a simple call of the tool.
However, it provides a wide range of options so that it can be used for comprehensive and special 
checks by experienced people.
